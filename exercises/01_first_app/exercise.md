* Create a repo on github with a simple `.yaml` file to deploy one pod of nginx.
    An example is attached.

* Create your first app on ArgoCD, which is connected to the previous repo and to the minikube cluster.
    * make it in the `default` project
    * deploy the app on the same minikube cluster that ArgoCD is on.

* Sync the ArgoCD and see that your pod is deployed.
